Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- Where can I see your demo?
https://clowdcap.github.io/404-Not-Found/

- What was your experience?
My experience executing this challenge, which is simple, but it is complex for me at first, but I managed to develop in a calm way, I had to do a lot of research to execute, where this was of excellent aggregation

- What have you learned/improved?
I had a great understanding of the sequences and positioning of the DIV tags, where I started to encapsulate in a more consistent and better understanding, so, when I was going to code in the CSS, I found it easier to achieve the result.

- Your wisdom? :)
I believe I was able to develop a better understanding of HTML and CSS in an application.

### Built With

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/wBunSb7FPrIepJZAg0sY) was to build an application to complete the given user stories.

Unfortunately I don't get much out of VS Code and my code was pure HTML and CSS.
